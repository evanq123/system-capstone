 * Sorted set API
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/* ZSETs are ordered sets using two data structures to hold the same elements
 * in order to get O(log(N)) INSERT and REMOVE operations into a sorted
 * data structure.
 *
 * The elements are added to a hash table mapping Redis objects to scores.
 * At the same time the elements are added to a skip list mapping scores
 * to Redis objects (so objects are sorted by scores in this "view").
 *
 * Note that the SDS string representing the element is the same in both
 * the hash table and skiplist in order to save memory. What we do in order
 * to manage the shared SDS string more easily is to free the SDS string
 * only in zslFreeNode(). The dictionary has no value free method set.
 * So we should always remove an element from the dictionary, and later from
 * the skiplist.
 *
 * This skiplist implementation is almost a C translation of the original
 * algorithm described by William Pugh in "Skip Lists: A Probabilistic
 * Alternative to Balanced Trees", modified in three ways:
 * a) this implementation allows for repeated scores.
 * b) the comparison is not just by key (our 'score') but by satellite data.
 * c) there is a back pointer, so it's a doubly linked list with the back
 * pointers being only at "level 1". This allows to traverse the list
 * from tail to head, useful for ZREVRANGE. */


/* For our case, we do not need to do c) and for a) we can point to list
 * for duplicate scores */
